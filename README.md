# TextEditor2.0
This is my second try at making a text editor, It will be made using C++ and maybe some python we'll see... Im using the GTKmm lib for the UI. Right now it has basic functionality like opening and saving file, having multiple tabs open and syntax highlighting for C. More features will be added when I find the time to work on this.

## How to compile?
You should have *Gtkmm* and *Gtkmm sourceview* installed. Then go to the directory which holds the source code and:

```
$ make
$ ./bin/hello
```
